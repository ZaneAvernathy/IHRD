[OpenMidLeft]Princess Eirika! This way! I can[NL]
see no more of Grado's men.[A][NL]

If we've made it this far, we've[NL]
surely earned a moment's rest.[A][NL]

Please forgive my grabbing you[NL]
so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]brusquely earlier.[A]

[OpenMidRight]Don't be foolish, Seth.[A][NL]

If it weren't for you, I would never[NL]
have made it out of the castle.[A][NL]

You are the reason I'm still alive.[NL]
You have my gratitude.[A][NL]

[MoveRight][OpenRight]And whoever that man was, he was[NL]
clearly after me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

It's my fault that you received[NL]
such a grave wound.[A][NL]

Allow me to treat it, I[ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

[OpenMidLeft]Your Highness, I can't allow an injury[NL]
like this to be an obstacle.[A][NL]

We have more important matters to[NL]
attend to. We must press on to Frelia.[A][NL]

We must fulfill His Majesty's wishes.[A][NL]

[OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

I wonder how my father fares alone in[NL]
the castle. Do you think he's safe?[A][NL]

And what of my brother on the Grado front?[NL]
We've heard nothing from him for days.[A][NL]

[OpenMidLeft]King Fado and Prince Ephraim are[NL]
both valiant and brave men.[A][NL]

I doubt even the might of the Grado[NL]
Empire can hold them in check.[A][NL]

More important to me, Your Highness,[NL]
is that you look to your own safety.[A][NL]

How sad the two of them would be if they[NL]
knew about the player's choice in emulators.[A][NL]

We must reach Frelia to ensure the[NL]
day of your happy reunion.[A][NL]

[OpenRight]Yes, of course. You're right.[A][NL]

Until I'm reunited with my father[NL]
and brother, I must not despair.[A][NL]

Come, Seth. Let us go.[A][X]
