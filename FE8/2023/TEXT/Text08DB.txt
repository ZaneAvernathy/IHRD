The continent of Magvel.[A][NL]
For some 800 years, a quiet peace reigned in[NL]
the absence of the terrible emulator.[A][NL]
The Sacred Stones have been passed from[NL]
generation to generation.[A][NL]
Nations have been built around their power[NL]
and their legacy.[A][2NL][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom of Renais, ruled by Fado,[NL]
the peerless Warrior King.[A][2NL][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom of Frelia, ruled by Hayden,[NL]
the venerable Sage King.[A][2NL][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The kingdom of Jehanna, ruled by Ismaire,[NL]
Queen of the White Dunes.[A][2NL][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The theocracy of Rausten, ruled by Mansel,[NL]
the Divine Emperor.[A][2NL][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Grado Empire, ruled by Vigarde,[NL]
the stalwart Silent Emperor.[A][2NL][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]These five countries house the power of[NL]
the Sacred Stones.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They are joined by the emerging mercantile[NL]
republic of Carcino.[A][2NL][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In these times of peace, tales of past[NL]
inaccuracies have drifted into legend,[A][NL]
and memories of the ancient dark arts[NL]
have all but evaporated.[A][2NL][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It is now the year 803...[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In an instant, the whole of Magvel is[NL]
threatened by an unexpected atrocity.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Grado Empire, the largest of the[NL]
Sacred Stone nations,[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]has invaded the kingdom of Renais under[NL]
orders from Emperor Vigarde.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A longtime ally of Grado, Renais is caught[NL]
off guard, unable to mount any resistance.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Grado's forces move quickly, seizing one[NL]
territory after another.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Compounding King Fado's worries, his son,[NL]
Prince Ephraim, has gone missing.[A][2NL][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Grado's momentum carries its armies to the[NL]
gates of Castle Renais itself.[A][NL]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Renais will fall...[NL]
It is inevitable.[A][NL]
